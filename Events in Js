JavaScript Events
The change in the state of an object is known as an Event. In html, there are various events which represents that some activity is performed by the user or by the browser. When javascript code is included in HTML, js react over these events and allow the execution. This process of reacting over the events is called Event Handling. Thus, js handles the HTML events via Event Handlers.

For example, when a user clicks over the browser, add js code, which will execute the task to be performed on the event.

Some of the HTML events and their event handlers are:

Mouse events:

mouseout	onmouseout	When the cursor of the mouse leaves an element
mousedown	onmousedown	When the mouse button is pressed over the element
mouseup	onmouseup	When the mouse button is released over the element
mousemove	onmousemove	When the mouse movement takes place.
